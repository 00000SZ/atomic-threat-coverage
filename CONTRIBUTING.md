We use following schema 

develop branch - Release candidate

master branch -  Release

It means that scheduled releases should be in master branch, and current prototype is in develop 

To add a new feature or fix a bug you should 
1. Create a branch from develop with name that would represent new feature or bug fixing
2. Push your changes into that branch
3. Create a merge request to develop branch
